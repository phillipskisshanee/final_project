              <li><b>How many clubs and student groups are there at Wash U?</b></li>
              <p>There are over 300 student groups on campus. Crazy, huh?</p>
              <p>We know what you are thinking, how am I ever going to decide what groups are right for me? Luckily for you, Wash U host an activity fair each semester where many of these 300 students groups will be in attendance, eagerly ready to inform you about their group.</p>
              <p>And if the activities fair sounds like too much in-your-face enthusiasm, then Wash Uâ€™s Student Union page allows to the research these groups too. <a href="http://su.wustl.edu/su-group-directory/" target="_blank">Student Group Directory</a></p>

           <br />
            <li>Do I have to join 5 different groups at Wash U</li>
            <p>If you have that much free time on your hand then sure, go for it. No one at Wash U is going to stop you from joining multiple clubs. Well maybe your advisor might not like that, but that's okay. </p>
            <p> Join whatever groups interest! </p>
